** TODO [#B] <2017-02-25 Sat> Starts timer
*** Timer could be like a Scribe -- a daemon which sits independently
    and does nothing while waiting to send a signal or be refreshed
*** Alternatively, users could refresh a lease value on activity, and
    the Timer can periodically check the value to get a new lease
*** TODO [#B] <2017-02-25 Sat> On timeout, Timer does some action
*** TODO [#B] <2017-02-25 Sat> On ws receiving bytes, refresh timer
*** TODO [#A] <2017-02-22 Wed> Decide how/whether to kill unwanted Timer
*** TODO [#B] <2017-02-22 Wed> Decide whether to model as abstract FSM
** Starts waiting for hangup signal
*** If receives hangup signal, closes and cleans up
** User disconnects
*** Closes and cleans hangup listener
*** TODO [#C] <2017-02-22 Wed> Gracefully stops timer
** Connection hangs up
*** Cleans up, stops listening for hangup
